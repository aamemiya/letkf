# Lorenz63

The origin of "butterfly" -- a simple 3-dimensional model of deterministic chaos

## Getting started
The main codes are written in Fortran90.  
To exec a job, use a shell script in which all the necessary processes (compilation, link, execution, copying input and output data) are wrapped.  
### Spinup and nature run
First, 'true' time evolution of the system needs to be prepared with the unbiased model.  
Spinup -- create an initial condition at an arbitrary point on the attractor of the system  
`cd model/run`  
`sh spinup_nature.sh`  
This creates the initial condition `DATA/spinup/init_nature.dat`  
 
Nature run -- create a sample time evolution  
`sh nature.sh` 
This creates `DATA/nature.dat`

<!--
### Create initial conditions
LETKF needs a set of initial conditions for ensemble forecasts.  
`cd model/run` 
`sh spinup.sh`
This creates `DATA/spinup/init.dat` and `DATA/spinup/initXX.dat` 
*be sure that these may be on a different attractor from that of nature run if the model has a bias
-->

### Create observation
Next, create observation time series.     
`cd obs`
`sh obsmake.sh`
This reads the 'true' data from nature.dat and applies observational filters; random additive noise and variable transformation(optional).  
Default setting is 'all', which means all varaibles are observed with random error of 1.0 standard deviation.
The resultant file is `DATA/all/obs.dat`. 

<!--
### Data Assimilation with LETKF
Now you are ready to start a data assimilation experiment with LETKF.  
`cd letkf`  
`sh letkf.sh`  
An observation type and a letkf experiment name are specified in `letkf.sh`. By default they are `all_02` and `test`.  
The following resultaint files in a directory `DATA/all_02/test/` are  
`analmean.dat`  
`guesmean.dat`  
`anal.dat`  
`gues.dat`  
`rmse_x.dat`  
`rmse_t.dat`  
### Data Assimilation with LETKF + bias correction
modify `letkf.sh`  
- letkf_DdSM.f90  
- letkf_reg.f90  
-->

### Reservoir computing
First, let us test the reservoir computing scheme 

     cd reservoir  
     sh rsv_test.sh     

This reads the nature run result from `DATA/nature.dat` and train the reservoir using first `nt_train` records. Then switch to forecast mode from `nt_train+1` step.
The forecast data is created as `DATA/fcst/fcst.dat`. It is identical to `nature.dat` up to `nt_train` and followed by resevoir-based forecasts.

The more formal way to verify the reservoir is to make forecast from a totally different initial condition.  

     sh rsv_fcst.sh

This trains the reservoir using first `nt_train` records of `nature_train.dat` in a similar way as before.  
Then it reads a different time series `nature_test.dat` for `nt_sync` to make the reservoir re-synclonize (without re-training) and start forecasting.  
**'training reusability'**  
Once the output layer function is trained by a standard linear regression, the trained reservoir can be used for any different initial conditions (as long as it is in the same attractor).  

### Visualization

For quicklook, the easiest way is to use [GrADS](http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/) (The Grid Analysis and Display System).   
Some ctl files are prepared in the same directory as data files.  

Other languages or tools may be more suitable for analysing data. Reading the data with fortran is straightforward. 
When you read data with other languages, be sure that there are buffer spaces in sequential data records as follows.   

     4 byte buffer 
     4*nx byte data array (t=1)
     4 byte buffer
     4 byte buffer 
     4*nx byte data array (t=2)
     4 byte array
